# Consession-System
Developed a student pass management system using Python, SQLite for a seamless user experience.
# Introduction to the project 
This project is a simple Python application that allows the management of 
student records, the generation of forms, and the creation of PDF documents for 
students using the Tkinter library for GUI creation and SQLite for database 
management. The main functionality of the application includes the generation 
of forms for students based on their roll numbers, the calculation of travel dates 
based on the selected period (Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly), and the creation 
of a corresponding certificate. 
Key features of the project: - User input for roll numbers and related student information. - Form generation, including dynamic date calculations. - Form generation containing travel details, class, period, and other related 
information. 

# Purpose of the project: 
The purpose of the project is to develop a software application that 
streamlines the process of generating, managing, and storing travel forms 
for students. The system is aimed at educational institutions, where the 
administration can use it to easily manage forms related to student travel 
passes. This includes the ability to generate forms, assign specific travel 
dates, and create PDF certificates. Additionally, the software will handle 
form validation, duplicate detection, and ensure proper record-keeping. 
The project is intended to: - Improve the efficiency of form management. - Reduce human error in generating forms. - Provide an easy-to-use interface for administrators to enter and access 
student data. - Automate the generation of PDFs and facilitate the storage and retrieval 
of generated forms.
